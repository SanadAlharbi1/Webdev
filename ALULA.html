<h1>ALULA</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<b>Al-Ula is one of the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is located in the northwest of the Kingdom. It is administratively affiliated with the Emirate of the Medina region. It is approximately 300 kilometers north of the center of the emirate, and it is the capital of Al-Ula Governorate. The age of human settlement there is about 4,000 years, and it is one of the most important tourist destinations in Saudi Arabia.</b>
<b>Home to boundless cultural treasures, including Saudi Arabia’s first UNESCO World Heritage site, AlUla is transforming into a once-in-a-lifetime experience for visitors from around the world.</b>
<b>With over 200,000 years of largely underexplored history, including the Nabataean city of Hegra, the ancient Kingdoms Dadanite and Lihyanite, and AlUla Old Town, AlUla’s rich heritage and bright future are open to explore.</b>
<b>The Royal Commission for AlUla is committed to a sustainable and responsible approach to the area’s urban, economic, and heritage development. Initiatives across archaeology, tourism, culture, education, and the arts are helping open this extraordinary destination to the world, all while preserving the area's remarkable natural and historic character.</b>
